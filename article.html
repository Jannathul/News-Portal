                <p>
                  After topping charts and selling out stadiums and festivals across the world, pop megastar Ed Sheeran spread his musical wings to the fictional world of Westeros in 2017, appearing as a singing soldier in the opening episode of series seven of Game of Thrones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The brief cameo saw him perform a previously unreleased song around the campfire with a group of Lannister soldiers, and catch the attention of the formidable Arya Stark (Maisie Williams).
                </p>
                <p>Sheeran's character was referenced again in 2019's final series after seemingly surviving a run-in with a dragon.
                </p>
                <p>The Shape of You singer is far from the only musician to have appeared on the show. Other cameos included members of Coldplay, Mastodon, Of Monsters and Men, Snow Patrol, Foals and Sigur Ros.
                <p>
                  But Sheeran's fleeting part proved divisive among viewers and cast members. Actor Kristian Nairn, who played Stark family servant Hodor in the show, questioned Sheeran's inclusion and described the celebrity guest spots in general as "stupid".
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I don't like them... I don't mind going on the record on that," he told Huffington Post. "I just think it takes you right out of the world."
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I was like: 'Why is Ed Sheeran here?' I mean, Ed Sheeran's great. He's a great guy, great musician, but why is he in Game Of Thrones?'
                </p>
                <p>            
                  "It's a fantasy show. We're all caught in this amazing world and spend so much time and money and talent to create, and all of a sudden there's a pop star? What?"</p>

              <p class="show-read-more">Real Madrid, Juventus and Barcelona, in a joint statement on Saturday, said it would be highly irresponsible to abandon Super League plans even as 9 of the other 12 founding members pulled out of plans following severe backlash from the football fraternity. 
                <br><br>
                  Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus said they will not give up on breakaway Super League plan but added they are ready to reconsider their approach. The three clubs, who were part of the 12 European elite, stepped up their criticism of the UEFA after the European football body said they will face sanctions and disciplinary proceedings.
                <br><br>
                  Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus, in a joint statement on Saturday, denounced the "unacceptable pressures and threats" for persisting with the Super League. Notably, the breakaway Super League which was formed last month collapsed within 48 hours after as many as 9 clubs, including 6 Premier League clubs, pulled out of it following massive backlash.

              Is it safe to go outdoors for a walk now? What doctors say
            </h3>
            <p class="show-read-more">As gyms continue to stay shut to slow down the spread of the Covid-19 virus, people have one question in mind - is it safe to walk outdoors? IndiaToday.in got in touch with a few medical experts and here's what they had to say.
            <br><br>  With the growing numbers of Covid-19 cases in India amid the second wave, we all must stay at home and follow all necessary protocols suggested by health officials. Many state governments have also imposed lockdowns to ensure that citizens don't break the rules and remain safe. This means all non-essential activities stay shut. Gyms have also continued to close their doors during these times to avoid the further spread of the deadly virus. This has forced many to ask one question: Is it safe to go for a walk outdoors?
            <br><br>  If you are also wondering the same, you are not alone. So, to help you out, IndiaToday.in got in touch with a few medical experts to answer this question. According to them, going for an outdoor walk is not at all advisable right now. However, if your health demands you to do so, follow all appropriate social distancing methods, and you will be safe.
            <br><br>  According to Dr Ankit Jain, a consultant physician at Neo Hospital in Noida, it is strictly advisable to stay inside. However, if your health demands you to go outside and work out, only then will it be okay, as long as one follows all social distancing guidelines.

However, it is not easy to do so if the person is diagnosed with depression. IndiaToday.in got in touch with doctors to ask them what a person suffering from depression should do to deal with Covid isolation.

               <br><br> In case you or someone around you is going through such similar feelings, then this article is for you. IndiaToday.in recently got in touch with clinical psychologists to talk to them about what a person suffering from depression should do to deal with Covid isolation.

                Covid-19 has called for a lot of focus on online learning. However, too much of it can make students feel isolated. Here are 4 ways teachers can personalise online learning for students.
               <br><br> Online courses offer higher-education learners of all stripes a flexible and accessible means of achieving their academic goals; however, they can run the risk of making students feel isolated and disconnected since offline interactions often aren’t a part of the package.
